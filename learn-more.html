  <h1>Learn More About Cows</h1>

  <p>Cows are gentle, intelligent animals that have been domesticated for thousands of years. They are primarily raised for dairy and beef production, and they play an essential role in agriculture worldwide.</p>

  <p>There are over 1,000 different breeds of cattle globally, each adapted to different climates and farming practices. Some cows are better suited for milk production, while others are raised for their meat quality or strength as work animals.</p>

  <p>Cows are also ruminants, meaning they have a four-chambered stomach that helps them digest tough plant materials like grass. This unique digestive system allows cows to convert plants into energy efficiently, making them important in sustainable farming systems.</p>

  <p>Fun fact: A cow can recognize over 100 other cows and forms close social bonds within their herd!</p>
