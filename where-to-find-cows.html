  <h1>Where to Find Cow Breeds</h1>

  <p><strong>Holstein:</strong> Originally from the Netherlands, Holsteins are now the most common dairy cow breed in the U.S. You’ll find them on large dairy farms across Wisconsin, California, and New York.</p>

  <p><strong>Jersey:</strong> These smaller cows hail from the British Channel Island of Jersey. Today, they’re popular on smaller dairy farms in states like Vermont and Pennsylvania for their rich milk.</p>

  <p><strong>Angus:</strong> A beef breed from Scotland, Angus cows are widely raised in Texas, Kansas, and Oklahoma. They’re known for their marbled meat and are a favorite in American ranching.</p>

  <p><strong>Hereford:</strong> Originally from England, Herefords are popular throughout the American Midwest. You’ll often see them in ranches across South Dakota, Nebraska, and Montana.</p>

  <p><strong>Guernsey:</strong> Another Channel Island breed, Guernseys are more rare but can be found on specialty dairy farms in the Northeast and parts of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
